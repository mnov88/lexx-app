Minimal required features:

1. Home -- big search bar for finding case-legislation by title, with autocomplete. 'Latest' section with most recent cases.
2. Legislation page - list of all legislation - titles and dates. Tapping one navigates to Legislation viewer. 
3. Legislation viewer - Landing page for individual legislation. Search bar searches through cases interpreting that legislation (for now just titles) and through full text of articles, showing their snippets with the search term highlighted. Under that, there is a list of all articles in the database, alongside their title, if they have any, each taking you to Article viewer. Another list similarly shows all cases interpreting legislation, with their case_id_text and parties and article_number_text of articles they interpret as a chip); tapping one takes you to Case viewer for that case. I am thinking that on desktop, the cards can show first 5 articles-cases and be side by side, expandable.
4. Case law page - a page with all cases in the database. At the top, full width a search bar with autocomplete, for now searching case law titles, similar to legislation page. Underneath, a list of all cases, by default shows all cases in reverse chronological order, alongside . Crucially, the case list is filterable in two steps. 
   a. First, user can pick legislation. In this case, all cases interpreting that legislation, sorted in reverse chronological order, are shown. 
   b. Secondly, users can also chose to 'group by article'. When they do, we get a list of all articles which are actually interpreted, sorted by article_number, lowest to highest, showing article_number_text and title and a separator, followed by CaseInfoCards. NB: smart filtering logic is crucial here -- we must look into which -operative part- interprets which article. For example, case C-123/123 might have 3 key rulings-operative parts: one interpreting article 1, second article 1 and 3, third 3 and 5. Case would show under article 1, 3 and 5. However, content of CaseInfoCard might be different, see below.
   c. Lastly, in either view, users can narrow down by article, from a list of articles which are interpreted by the case.
5. CaseInfoCard shows case_id_text (C-123/123) and date at the top, as secondary info and parties (A v B) on a line under, in italics. Tapping the card navigates to case. Now, important: on case law page, we have a toggle to show/hide operative parts, and, if showing, toggle between simplified and full. If off, we show nothing. If on, we look up which operative part interprets the article ie operative_part_interprets_article and show its verbatim_text, as an admonition, quote or similar (perhaps a nice vertical line). Toggling simplified operative parts globally simply switches to simplified_text for that operative part. Now, which operative parts are shown depends on where the card is used. If user is showing all cases interpreting legislation, each case is shown only once, in reverse chronological order; hence, all of its operative parts are shown here. If user groups by article, however, as seen above, different operative parts in a case can interpret multiple articles, so the case might show up multiple times. In this case, under Article 1, it would show operative part 1 and 2; but might only show operative part 3 under Article 5. The same applies if we decide to use CaseInfoCard on Article viewer, see below.
6. Article viewer is a page showing an individual article in legislation, seamless to navigate to from Legislation viewer, Case law page, chips, and other components. It shows article_number_text and article_title (if any) in prominent font, the latter italic, followed by the text of the article and a list of CaseInfoCards with operative parts from cases interpreting it. The same logic as above applies, operative parts can be off-verbatim-simplified; and only those interpreting that specific article should be shown. We should also allow jumping to previous-next articles and showing ToC of other articles in the same legislation.
   7. Case law viewer serves a similar purpose: it lets user read a particular case. I am picturing a three-pane layout. 
      Center pane is the main reading view showing text of the case.
      At the top, case_id_text (C-123/123) and date at the top (first one all the way to the left, latter on the right), as secondary info and parties (A v B) on a line under, in italics. 
      Left and right sidebar
      To ensure quick skimmability, operative parts, as key ruling takeaways, simplified/verbatim toggle and ToC are placed on the left side, whereas the right side shows 'Articles interpreted'. In the future, we will add 'Referenced cases'-'References cases' underneath, so we can have a placeholder for now. Sidebars should be scrollable on their own if they exceed screen size. Rather than distinguishing sidebars with their different background color, we can make the actual case text - in the central pane - look like a sheet of paper -- ie use shadows to give it that 'paper feel' and constrain width accordingly -- this all being necessary on desktop only.
       (On mobile, we avoid the sidebar. We have id and parties, followed by a date and a subtle separator. Under this, on the same row, we have 2 buttons - one opens a ToC as a sheet, and the other one does the same showing references - articles interpreted, cases referenced-referencing. The buttons are followed by operative parts section, smaller text, subtle accent, perhaps vertical line, collapsible, expanded by default - simplified/verbatim toggle. Case text follows underneath.)
8. Report builder -- this is a page which, in essence, does the same filtering as Case law page, ie lets user select legislation-articles and shows cases/operative parts interpreting them. What is different, however, is that it lets users create beautiful, modern, print-ready reports from data retreived, generated as HTML, using wonderful legal typography. Users can pick if they want operative parts, of which kind, if they want to include text of articles. The design is carefully made, as to ensure there is beautiful, print-friendly visual hierarchy, information structure, strategic use of font-typeface-styles-backgrounds.
9. In the future, a complete system will be implemented to allow for interaction with an AI chatbot. For now, a placeholder page will do.
