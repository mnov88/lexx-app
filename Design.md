Design considerations: minimalistic design with whitespace and optimized both for desktop and mobile. Modern look and feel, avoiding typical SaaS look, customized as needed for wonderful reading and modern typography, using Google fonts. Dark mode support, typeface toggle, font size toggle. We avoid strong colors, and use accents very sparingly - a good example would be to visually designate an operative part, subtly, or on hover over ToC element. References to 'Cards' do not necessarily mean cards in visual sense -- when we can, we should consider using space, font properties and other methods of distinguishing and grouping information. The interface should feel very snappy and smooth -- animations should be there, but subtle, like small moments of joy. Text on our interface should not capitalize each proper noun, ie we prefer 'Case law' instead of 'Case Law'.
