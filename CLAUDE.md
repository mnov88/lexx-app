# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a legal software project for browsing EU legislation and case law. The system allows lawyers to navigate legislation article by article, discover case law that interprets specific articles, and generate reports. Key features include:

- Article-by-article navigation of EU legislation
- Case law interpretation linking to specific articles  
- Bidirectional navigation between legislation and case law
- Report generation for operative parts per selected articles
- Search functionality across legislation and case law

## Database Architecture

The project uses Supabase with the following core entities:

### Core Tables
- `legislations` - EU legislation documents with CELEX numbers, titles, markdown content
- `articles` - Individual articles within legislation, linked to parent legislation
- `case_laws` - CJEU case law with operative parts, HTML/plaintext content
- `operative_parts` - Individual rulings within cases that interpret specific articles
- `document_chunks` - Text chunks with embeddings for search functionality

### Key Relationships
- `case_law_interprets_article` - Links cases to articles they interpret (convenience table)
- `operative_part_interprets_article` - Links specific operative parts to articles (primary relationship)
- `operative_part_mentions_legislation` - Tracks legislative references in operative parts

### Important Notes
- `operative_part_mentions_article` is deprecated; use `interprets_article` instead
- The relationship between case law and articles is primarily through operative parts
- Each operative part has both `verbatim_text` and `simplified_text` versions

## Development Status

## Feature Completeness Assessment

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Feature Status (60% Complete)**
**Reality Check: Many "completed" features are non-functional**

#### **Actually Working:**
- **üèóÔ∏è Architecture**: Three-pane case viewer layout ‚úÖ
- **üîç Navigation**: Basic navigation with hydration fixes ‚úÖ
- **üì± Mobile**: Responsive design components ‚úÖ
- **üé® UI/UX**: Visual styling and markdown rendering ‚úÖ

#### **Broken Despite Implementation:**
- **üìÑ Reports**: UI exists but completely non-functional ‚ùå
- **üîê Authentication**: Infrastructure exists but bypassed for testing ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **üìä Performance**: APIs hang or timeout, not optimized ‚ùå
- **üîç Advanced Features**: Many components return empty/mock data ‚ùå

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING RESOLUTION (40%)**

#### **Major Broken Functionality:**
1. **Reports System Completely Non-Functional**
   - Report generation hangs or takes excessive time
   - No actual content appears in generated reports
   - Configuration settings have no effect on output
   - Download functionality crashes
   - API integration broken despite surface-level fixes

2. **Data Integration Issues**
   - Legislation data not loading in reports interface
   - Mock/placeholder data being returned instead of real content
   - Database queries not properly integrated with UI components

3. **Performance Problems**
   - Report generation API calls hang indefinitely
   - Possible infinite loops or unoptimized database queries
   - Frontend-backend integration gaps

#### **Working Components:**
- ‚úÖ Case viewer with markdown rendering and ToC
- ‚úÖ Navigation with proper hydration fixes
- ‚úÖ Basic API endpoints (legislations, cases, articles)
- ‚úÖ Authentication infrastructure (when enabled)
- ‚úÖ Responsive design and UI components

### üö® **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**
**Current Status: DEVELOPMENT INCOMPLETE**
- Critical report functionality is broken
- Major features don't work as advertised
- Significant debugging and re-implementation required

## Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (runs on available port, usually 3000-3002)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (all 20 pages compile successfully)
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript check

### Testing & Monitoring
- Health checks: `/api/health` (comprehensive), `/api/health/ready`, `/api/health/live`  
- Database test: `/api/test-db` - Verify Supabase connection
- Authentication: `/auth` - Complete login/signup flow with role selection
- Three-pane viewer: `/cases/[id]` - Advanced case law research interface ‚úÖ WORKING
- Report builder: `/reports` - ‚ùå BROKEN - UI loads but functionality fails

### Known Issues & Debugging
- **Reports API**: Hangs on generation, returns empty data
- **Download Crashes**: HTML download functionality fails
- **Data Loading**: Legislation selection not working in reports interface  
- **Performance**: API calls take excessive time or timeout
- **Integration**: Frontend-backend data flow broken despite API responses

## Next Steps for Future Development

### High Priority Fixes Required:
1. **Debug Report Generation Pipeline**
   - Investigate why API calls hang or timeout
   - Fix database query performance issues
   - Ensure proper data flow from selection to generation
   - Fix download functionality crashes

2. **Data Integration Repair**
   - Fix legislation loading in reports interface
   - Ensure real data (not mock/placeholder) flows through system
   - Debug frontend-backend API integration gaps

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify and fix hanging API calls
   - Optimize database queries for report generation
   - Implement proper error handling and timeouts

### Technical Debt:
- Remove temporary authentication bypasses
- Clean up debug logging and test code
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add comprehensive testing for critical flows

- Toggle between simplified and verbatim operative part text

## Design Philosophy

- Minimalistic design with generous whitespace
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile
- Modern typography using Google fonts
- Dark mode support with font size/typeface toggles
- Subtle animations and micro-interactions
- Avoid typical SaaS aesthetics - focus on reading experience
- Strategic use of accents and visual hierarchy
- Preference for "Case law" over "Case Law" (sentence case)
