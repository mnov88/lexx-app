# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a legal software project for browsing EU legislation and case law. The system allows lawyers to navigate legislation article by article, discover case law that interprets specific articles, and generate reports. Key features include:

- Article-by-article navigation of EU legislation
- Case law interpretation linking to specific articles  
- Bidirectional navigation between legislation and case law
- Report generation for operative parts per selected articles
- Search functionality across legislation and case law

## Database Architecture

The project uses Supabase with the following core entities:

### Core Tables
- `legislations` - EU legislation documents with CELEX numbers, titles, markdown content
- `articles` - Individual articles within legislation, linked to parent legislation
- `case_laws` - CJEU case law with operative parts, HTML/plaintext content
- `operative_parts` - Individual rulings within cases that interpret specific articles
- `document_chunks` - Text chunks with embeddings for search functionality

### Key Relationships
- `case_law_interprets_article` - Links cases to articles they interpret (convenience table)
- `operative_part_interprets_article` - Links specific operative parts to articles (primary relationship)
- `operative_part_mentions_legislation` - Tracks legislative references in operative parts

### Important Notes
- `operative_part_mentions_article` is deprecated; use `interprets_article` instead
- The relationship between case law and articles is primarily through operative parts
- Each operative part has both `verbatim_text` and `simplified_text` versions

## Production Infrastructure Details

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Supabase Auth with email/password
- **Roles**: `lawyer`, `admin`, `readonly` with different access levels
- **Features**: User registration, login, logout, role-based route protection
- **Implementation**: `AuthProvider` context with middleware protection

### Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Memory-based with role-specific quotas (Readonly: 100/min, Lawyer: 500/min, Admin: 1000/min)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization with XSS/SQL injection prevention
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based authentication and authorization
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes

### Performance & Caching
- **Caching Strategy**: Memory-based LRU cache with tag-based invalidation
- **API Optimization**: Pagination with metadata, response caching headers
- **Database**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
- **Build**: Static generation for all pages, optimized bundle size

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health Checks**: `/api/health`, `/api/health/ready`, `/api/health/live`
- **Structured Logging**: Multiple log levels with context-aware metadata
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging with stack traces
- **Performance Metrics**: Request timing and database query monitoring

## API Response Format

All list endpoints return paginated responses:
```typescript
{
  data: T[], // Array of results
  pagination: {
    currentPage: number,
    totalPages: number,
    totalItems: number,
    itemsPerPage: number,
    hasNext: boolean,
    hasPrev: boolean,
    nextOffset: number | null,
    prevOffset: number | null
  },
  metadata: {
    filters: object,
    requestTime: string
  }
}
```

## Design Philosophy

- Minimalistic design with generous whitespace
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile
- Modern typography using Google fonts
- Dark mode support with font size/typeface toggles
- Subtle animations and micro-interactions
- Avoid typical SaaS aesthetics - focus on reading experience
- Strategic use of accents and visual hierarchy
- Preference for "Case law" over "Case Law" (sentence case)
