# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a legal software project for browsing EU legislation and case law. The system allows lawyers to navigate legislation article by article, discover case law that interprets specific articles, and generate reports. Key features include:

- Article-by-article navigation of EU legislation
- Case law interpretation linking to specific articles  
- Bidirectional navigation between legislation and case law
- Report generation for operative parts per selected articles
- Search functionality across legislation and case law

## Database Architecture

The project uses Supabase with the following core entities:

### Core Tables
- `legislations` - EU legislation documents with CELEX numbers, titles, markdown content
- `articles` - Individual articles within legislation, linked to parent legislation
- `case_laws` - CJEU case law with operative parts, HTML/plaintext content
- `operative_parts` - Individual rulings within cases that interpret specific articles
- `document_chunks` - Text chunks with embeddings for search functionality

### Key Relationships
- `case_law_interprets_article` - Links cases to articles they interpret (convenience table)
- `operative_part_interprets_article` - Links specific operative parts to articles (primary relationship)
- `operative_part_mentions_legislation` - Tracks legislative references in operative parts

### Important Notes
- `operative_part_mentions_article` is deprecated; use `interprets_article` instead
- The relationship between case law and articles is primarily through operative parts
- Each operative part has both `verbatim_text` and `simplified_text` versions
